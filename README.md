## How to run

All solutions expect input on stdin and produce the answer on stdout

The following is an example of running a java solution:

```
javac Fuel.java
java Fuel < input.txt > ans.txt
```

In the above, input.txt is the path to the input file, and ans.txt is the path to the file where
you would like the answer to be written. You can leave out `> ans.txt` if you would prefer the answer
be shown in the terminal.
